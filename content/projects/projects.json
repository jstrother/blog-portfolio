      "description": "This is a fantasy soccer league that pulls in real-world statistics from over 40 real leagues around the world. A user is then able to create a fantasy team based upon one of those leagues, choose players, set a lineup, and compete against other users. This will be built using NuxtJS for the front, NestJS for the back, and MongoDB/Mongoose for storage. This project is going to be my most challenging project to date as I have to not only design the layout, but also determine how the various pieces need to interact with one another.",

Then, it uses the Google Maps API and the Open Brewer Database to find locations near you and, finally, gives you directions in an embedded Google map. Give it a try and 'Wet Your Whistle'!",

Each letter has been replaced with another one (ie- all A's have been replaced with J's). The encryption is different each time, so you'll never play the same game twice! Built with NuxtJS (and love!). Just to let you know, it is hosted on a free Heroku dyno, so give it a few extra seconds to fully spin up.",

Although initially built as pure HTML, CSS, and JS, I refactored this when I started learning React and Redux. First, I created the necessary React components to control the view. Then, I used Redux to set up the flow of data through the app. This was the project that taught me the value of state and how to control it properly.",
