## The Issue at Hand

Many of us, and rightly so, are concerned about the effects of the changing climate and how that affects our planet. This has spurred many attempts at averting potential disaster from solar cells and wind turbines to carbon sequestration and nuclear fusion. But, what can we as web developers do to help? After all, the web is just a collection of 1's and 0's, right? You might be forgiven for thinking there isn't much we can do in this industry and that we should continue business as usual.

And what exactly is the issue with those 1's and 0's anyway? In and of themselves, nothing. But, by 2025, [20% of the world's electricity][1] is expected to be consumed by data centers creating about 3.5% of global emissions. With the internet not going anywhere anytime soon, it seems like our industry is destined to be one of the largest perils to our planet and there's no way to counter that.

## Suggestions for Solutions

But, what if I told you there are three simple things we could do to help out? These  really only require a few minutes of extra effort for the most part. First, we need to measure the estimated emissions our sites produce. This lets us know, instead of guess, how good or bad things are. Second, we need to be more efficient with our coding practices. More data transferred means more electricity used, and if that's from dirty sources it's a problem. Last, we have to find green web hosts who either get their energy from renewable sources or compensate in one way or another for emissions created.

### Getting a Feel for the Problem

Unless you know how big the problem is, how do you know how to go about fixing it? I'll admit, it has been difficult for us as developers, and even designers, to know the impact our sites are having. Recently, a new tool was released to help us: [Website Carbon Calculator][2]. I ran it on [my site][3] the other day and it showed me that I'm not doing too bad, but then again, I'm not exactly running [ESPN][4] either. It makes sense that a simple portfolio site with an attached blog is pretty efficient, especially as compared to the behemoth that covers the world of sports. But, now we know, right?

(Note: give those last two links a few seconds to load, the carbon calculator runs each time you click the link.)
